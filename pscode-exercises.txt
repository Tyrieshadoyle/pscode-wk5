// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers
a = n1 
b = n2 
Sum= (a+b)
print results
// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
input n
remainder= n%2
IF remainder is not equal to 0
answer=odd
ELSE
answer=even
print results 
// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers. 
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

a)input 5,6,7,8,9
b)avg=(5+6+7+8+9)/5
c)min= if n1<n2 then 
minimum is n1
max= if n1>n2 then 
maximum is n1
print results 
d)5+6=11 11+7=18 18+8=26 26+9=35
35/5=7
The average of the numbers is 7 
5<6 6<7 7<8 8<9
9>8 8>7 7>6 6>5
The minimum is 5 
The maximum is 9
